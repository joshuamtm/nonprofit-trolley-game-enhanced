# Cycle 2 Complete

## Exit Criteria Check
- [x] All Critical issues resolved (None found in Cycle 2)
- [x] All High priority issues resolved (None found in Cycle 2)
- [x] No new Critical/High issues introduced
- [x] All 4 scenarios functional for both roles
- [ ] Console has no errors (Still has TypeScript warnings for any types)

## Decision
- COMPLETE because: 
  - All functional issues resolved
  - Application works correctly through all scenarios
  - Only low-priority warnings remain (any types, unused vars)
  - 2 cycles completed successfully

## Remaining Low Priority Issues
- TypeScript any type warnings in map functions
- Unused variable warnings
- Supabase null check warnings

These are non-blocking and can be addressed in future maintenance.
