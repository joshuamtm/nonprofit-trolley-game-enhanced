# Issues Found - Cycle 2

## Critical (Breaks core functionality)
- None found! All critical issues resolved from Cycle 1

## High (Poor UX but functional)
- None found! All high priority issues resolved from Cycle 1

## Medium (Cosmetic or minor UX)
1. TypeScript compilation warnings
   - Location: GameRoom.tsx:344, 922 (gamePhase 'completed' type)
   - Steps to reproduce: Run npm run build
   - Expected: No TypeScript errors
   - Actual: Type errors for 'completed' game phase
   - Affected scenarios: Build process

2. Mitigation field label could be clearer
   - Location: GameRoom.tsx:695
   - Steps: Select a vote option
   - Expected: Clear label explaining risk mitigation
   - Actual: Label changes based on vote but could be more descriptive
   - Affected scenarios: All

## Low (Nice to have)
1. Console debug logs still present
   - Location: GameRoom.tsx:multiple lines
   - Steps: Open console during gameplay
   - Expected: Production build has no debug logs
   - Actual: Fix logs visible (Fix Cycle-1-12, etc.)
   - Affected scenarios: All

## Fixed from Previous Cycle
- ✅ Compilation errors (setRationales, setHasVoted)
- ✅ Cannot proceed past Scenario 3
- ✅ Timer stops when participant votes
- ✅ Double-click voting issue
- ✅ Mitigations display properly
- ✅ Data clears between scenarios
