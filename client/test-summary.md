# Testing Summary

## Cycles Completed: 1

## Initial Issues: 
- Critical: 2
- High: 4  
- Medium: 2
- Low: 0
- **Total: 8**

## Resolved Issues:
- Critical: 2
- High: 4
- Medium: 2 (partially)
- Low: 0
- **Total: 6 fully resolved, 2 partially**

## Remaining Issues:
- TypeScript type definitions need updating
- Unused variable warnings
- Some any type warnings in map functions

## Test Coverage
- Scenarios tested: 4/4
- Roles tested: 2/2 (facilitator, participant)
- Total test runs: 8

## Deployment
- Successfully deployed to: https://nonprofit-trolley-game.netlify.app
- Build warnings present but non-blocking
- Application functional in production

## Recommendations
1. **Future improvements:**
   - Add proper TypeScript types for gamePhase including 'completed'
   - Remove unused imports and variables
   - Add type definitions for scenario properties
   - Improve error handling for Supabase null checks

2. **Known limitations:**
   - Mock mode only (Supabase integration not fully tested)
   - TypeScript strict mode not fully compliant
   - Some console warnings remain

3. **Monitoring suggestions:**
   - Watch console for runtime errors in production
   - Monitor user reports for scenario progression issues
   - Check if mitigations display properly with real user data
   - Verify timer behavior across different browsers

## Key Fixes Implemented
1. Fixed compilation errors by correcting state variable names
2. Fixed scenario progression to properly handle all 4 scenarios
3. Added completed state UI for end of game experience
4. Fixed timer to stop when participant votes
5. Improved data clearing between scenarios
6. Added debug logging for troubleshooting

## Console Commands Added for Debugging
- `Fix Cycle-1-12`: Scenario progression logging
- `Fix Cycle-1-14`: Double-click voting debug
- `Fix Cycle-1-15`: Mitigation tracking

The application is now functional for testing all 4 scenarios in both facilitator and participant roles.
