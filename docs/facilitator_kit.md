# Facilitator's Guide: Nonprofit Trolley Game

## Quick Start Guide

### Before Your Session
1. **Test your setup**: Visit the app and create a test room
2. **Review scenarios**: Read through available scenarios and select 3-5 for your session
3. **Prepare framing**: Plan how you'll introduce AI ethics to your audience
4. **Check tech requirements**: Ensure participants have smartphones/devices with QR scanners

### Running a Session

#### 1. Room Setup (2 minutes)
```
1. Navigate to facilitator dashboard
2. Click "Create New Room"
3. Configure settings:
   - Timer: 30 seconds (recommended for first-timers)
   - Moderation: ON (filters inappropriate content)
   - Content Warnings: ON (shows warnings for sensitive topics)
4. Select scenarios in order
5. Share QR code on screen
```

#### 2. Participant Onboarding (3 minutes)
- "Scan the QR code to join - no app download needed!"
- "You'll vote anonymously on ethical dilemmas"
- "Add a brief rationale (under 8 words) to explain your choice"
- "Watch as everyone's reasoning creates word clouds"

#### 3. Running Rounds (5 minutes per scenario)
1. **Introduce** (30 seconds): Read scenario aloud
2. **Vote** (30 seconds): Participants vote and add rationales
3. **Observe** (30 seconds): Watch word clouds form
4. **Reveal** (30 seconds): Trolley animation shows group decision
5. **Discuss** (3 minutes): Facilitate group reflection

#### 4. Facilitating Discussion

##### Opening Questions
- "What patterns do you notice in the word clouds?"
- "Were you surprised by the group's decision?"
- "What assumptions influenced your vote?"

##### Deeper Exploration
- "Who benefits from each choice? Who might be harmed?"
- "What values are in tension here?"
- "How might this apply to your organization?"

##### Closing Synthesis
- "What themes emerged across scenarios?"
- "How do we balance efficiency with equity?"
- "What safeguards might we need with AI?"

## Scenario Selection Guide

### For Beginners
Start with lower-stakes scenarios:
1. **Donor Engagement**: Explores efficiency vs. community
2. **Volunteer Matching**: Discusses optimization vs. inclusion
3. **Scholarship Selection**: Examines bias in evaluation

### For Intermediate Groups
Add complexity and stakes:
1. **Food Bank Allocation**: Serving more vs. protecting vulnerable
2. **Healthcare Navigation**: Scale vs. complex cases
3. **Disaster Relief**: Speed vs. inclusivity

### For Advanced Discussions
High-stakes ethical dilemmas:
1. **Youth Mental Health**: Life-or-death decisions with AI
2. **Homeless Services**: Systemic exclusion risks
3. **Community Grants**: What we value vs. what we measure

## Managing Difficult Moments

### If Discussion Gets Heated
- Acknowledge emotions: "This touches on deeply held values"
- Refocus on learning: "What can we learn from different perspectives?"
- Use word clouds: "Let's look at the range of concerns expressed"

### If Technology Fails
- Have backup slides with scenarios
- Run verbal voting if needed
- Focus on discussion over technology

### If Inappropriate Content Appears
- Moderation filters catch most issues automatically
- Use facilitator override to skip/hide content
- Address briefly: "Let's maintain respectful dialogue"

## Accessibility Considerations

### For Participants with Disabilities
- **Visual**: Scenarios are screen-reader compatible
- **Motor**: Extended timer option available (up to 120 seconds)
- **Cognitive**: Simplify language when presenting scenarios

### Language Support
- Encourage participants to write rationales in their preferred language
- Word clouds will cluster similar concepts even across languages
- Facilitator can translate key themes during discussion

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Test the system before your session
- ✅ Frame scenarios neutrally when introducing
- ✅ Encourage diverse perspectives
- ✅ Connect scenarios to participants' real experiences
- ✅ Leave time for synthesis and action planning

### DON'T:
- ❌ Rush through scenarios
- ❌ Judge participants' choices
- ❌ Skip the discussion portions
- ❌ Focus only on the technology
- ❌ Assume consensus means correctness

## Adapting for Different Audiences

### Board Members / Leadership
- Focus on governance and strategic implications
- Use grant allocation and donor scenarios
- Emphasize long-term organizational impact

### Frontline Staff
- Use service delivery scenarios
- Focus on client impact and daily operations
- Explore tension between efficiency and relationships

### Community Members
- Use accessible language, avoid jargon
- Focus on scenarios affecting their communities
- Emphasize collective decision-making

### Students / Youth Groups
- Use relatable scenarios (scholarship, mental health)
- Encourage creative thinking about solutions
- Focus on building critical thinking skills

## Post-Session Actions

### Immediate (Same Day)
1. Export session data for records
2. Send thank-you with key takeaways
3. Share resources on AI ethics in nonprofits

### Follow-Up (Within Week)
1. Share session report with visualizations
2. Provide additional reading/resources
3. Schedule follow-up discussions if requested

### Long-Term Integration
1. Incorporate insights into AI strategy
2. Develop organizational AI principles
3. Create safeguards based on concerns raised

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Low participation | Ensure QR code is visible; give verbal encouragement |
| Technical difficulties | Have co-facilitator help with tech; focus on discussion |
| Dominant voices | Use word clouds to show all perspectives; call on quiet participants |
| Confusion about scenarios | Re-read slowly; clarify assumptions; invite questions |
| Time running over | Reduce scenarios; shorten discussion; plan follow-up session |

## Evaluation Metrics

Track these to improve your facilitation:

### Quantitative
- Participation rate (votes/attendees)
- Rationale submission rate
- Scenario completion rate
- Technical issue frequency

### Qualitative
- Quality of discussions
- Diversity of perspectives shared
- Actionable insights generated
