  "context": "Your nonprofit coordinates 1,000 volunteers across 20 programs. An AI matching system could analyze skills, availability, and personality to optimize placements, potentially increasing volunteer retention by 40% and impact by 25%. However, it might exclude volunteers with disabilities, irregular schedules, or those whose contributions don't fit neat categories, potentially losing 100 dedicated but 'inefficient' volunteers who provide crucial community connections.",
  "ai_option": "Pull the lever: Deploy AI matching to optimize volunteer placement and increase overall program impact.",
  "non_ai_option": "Don't pull: Keep human coordinators who understand individual circumstances and hidden contributions.",
  "assumptions": [
    "Current volunteer retention rate is 60% annually",
    "AI uses personality tests, availability data, and skill assessments",
    "10% of volunteers have non-standard contributions"
