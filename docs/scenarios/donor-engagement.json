  "context": "Your nonprofit needs to raise $1M annually to maintain services. An AI system analyzing donor data could identify high-potential major donors and optimize outreach timing, potentially increasing donations by 30% ($300K). However, this system would deprioritize small-dollar grassroots donors who provide community legitimacy and volunteer hours, possibly alienating the 2,000 donors who give under $100 but provide 5,000 volunteer hours annually.",
  "ai_option": "Pull the lever: Use AI to maximize donation revenue through targeted major donor cultivation.",
  "non_ai_option": "Don't pull: Maintain current inclusive approach that values all donors equally regardless of capacity.",
  "assumptions": [
    "Major donors (>$1,000) comprise 20% of donors but 80% of revenue",
    "Small donors (<$100) comprise 70% of donors and 60% of volunteers",
    "AI can predict optimal engagement timing with 75% accuracy"
