  "context": "Your foundation distributes $5M in grants to 50 community organizations annually. An AI system could analyze impact metrics, financial health, and community needs data to identify high-impact organizations, potentially increasing measurable community benefit by 35%. However, it would favor organizations with strong data collection over grassroots groups doing critical but hard-to-measure work, potentially defunding 10-15 small culturally-specific organizations.",
  "ai_option": "Pull the lever: Use AI to maximize measurable impact, increasing community benefit metrics by 35%.",
  "non_ai_option": "Don't pull: Keep human review process that values relationship-building and hard-to-quantify community trust.",
  "assumptions": [
    "Large organizations have dedicated data staff",
    "Grassroots organizations serve specific cultural communities",
    "Current process includes site visits and community input"
