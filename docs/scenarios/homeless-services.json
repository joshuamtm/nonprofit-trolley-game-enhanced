An AI system could predict which individuals are most likely to successfully transition to permanent housing with support, potentially housing 50 more people permanently per year. However, this would deprioritize those with severe mental illness or addiction who are 'less likely to succeed' according to the algorithm, possibly condemning them to chronic homelessness.",
